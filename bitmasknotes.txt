notes on bitmasks

probably want everythin in same from and into collision bitmasks

only using spheres for 

any thing else that the spheres collide with to same bitmask

they had different object types so they had the player one bucket, a character, a projectile

into will be whatever you set as the from

level geometry you want it to be on a different bitmask from sphere that you match to rays then get performance increase

bitmask is int 32

all zeros or ones

<< left shift it by x you are talking about xth bit

you use bitwise and or or to worry about it

you are just going to be using different collision sets

just use power of two integers for no overlap

if we bitwised or two power of two integers together then collisions would be betwen both of them
