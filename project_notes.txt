Settings:
Space (flying or on wheels)
Desert (on wheels) 
Cave (flying or on wheels)(potential cave in space asteroid)
The Moon (on wheels)

Gameplay:
Arena vs. Race

Arena:
-open environment
-hunt down enemies and targets
-enemies and targets could be a variety of things.
-potential king of the hill idea

Race:
-closed race track
-shoot racers to gain advantage
-Enemies are other racers

Main method of attack:
-melee
    -how do damage? (revisable)
        -shockwave attack
        -big freaking hammer?
        -flip enemies? (potential side effect)
        -chainsaws EVERYWHERE
    -recoil damage?
        -are you damaged by collision?
        -how enemies damage you if you damage them by hitting
        -resolve "demolition derby" concerns
        -melee weapon deals only damage no danger
        -melee can be tricky without polished controls is a concern
    -Concerns
        -could require tricky positioning which requires smooth and consistent control
            -solution: increase range for more leeway-make it loooooooooooooong
        -would make situations of being surrounded more likely.
            -gameplay could be slowed down due to looking for opportunities to not be surrounded.  
            -requirement for ai is that our enemies do not accidentally lump together when chasing player
                -clumped enemies would be easier to take out
                -potentially riskier
                -but would not want to always clump together: exception to rule
-or shooting
    -what shoot?
    -easier to resolve "demolition derby" concerns
-additional discussions
    -electromagnet[spacespacespacespacespace]
        -make your ship emit a magnetic pulse that pulls or pushes things [for space theme]
            -pull power ups and junk
            -enemies
                -push enemies away
                -or drag enemies around
        -do as much diverse stuff as possible
            -mining all the things, gravity gun mechanics
            -perhaps some enemies that cannot be directly affected by magnets
        -resolve player getting surrounded: make a possible positive
            -limited by a rechargeable energy bar
            -full energy bar means super powerful attack
    -tractor beam [space]
        - + disable
        -get collision damage if hit you
        -drag in to launch with maximum power with magnet
            

Enemies: 
-skins based on location
    -enemy do: 
        -leap into air, ground pound, make vulnerable in air, so then you smack them
    -enemy behave:
        -make the randoms: excluding general aim for player.
        
Controls: 
    -
    
    
Collectibles
    -besides being for score and what you could come up with: collectibles do good stuff
        -up your energy bar [space]

additional stuff: 
-have a cool boss that the gameplay is focused on.  would simplify ai time limitations (easier).
-common ideas is that boss is centralized.  

boss progression:
-have combat that does not revolve around boss
-get the player to get used to it
-potential to have the boss introduce waves of enemies: the boss is main and visible catalyst (presented but not immediately attackable)
    -idea: boss unreachable--flying? [spawns enemies from air?]
    -idea: boss unreachable--underground? [spawns enemies from underground?]
    -idea: boss shielded by enemies...  technically immediately attackable not based on time dealing with enemies
    
    
    
    
other stuff:     
    -vehicle customization for specializing in melee or ranged seems beyond the scope of a two week project (potentially rejected)
    -
    
other stuff2:
    -asteroid: compete for mining an asteroid
        -not combat focused?
        -consensus is nothing with advanced ai
            -ideally we want success with randomized ai behavior; limits on random that yield success
            -enemy does not strategize
    -what if setting is boss (mario galaxy reference?-boss is same size as planet)
        -boss giant vehicle
            -constrains possibilities of surrounding environment
                -must be large environment
                -boss in environment you on boss?  or boss all environment?  IMMA FIRIN MAH DEATH STAR
    -general comments on discussion has leaned toward arena setting and ground based combat, more focus has been paid to resolving potential issues of melee combat
    -water: above is 2d, under is 3d
    -switch between ground and space?   haaaaaard
    -we are driving to an antique show because awesome deals
        -freaking chairs and vinyl
